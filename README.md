# koi

Koi is a wrapper around kubectl that provides additional features:

## -x shorthand flag for --context

## `export` commandlet you can pipe `kubectl get secrets -o yaml` to

## `-o=yq` for pretty-print yaml. Also, supports `-o=jq`. 

## `--yq=FILTER` to do output to yq and pass that filter to yq. Same applies to `--jq=FILTER`
